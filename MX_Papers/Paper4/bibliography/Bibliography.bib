abstract = {This paper compares six model checkers (Alloy, cadp, fdr2, NuSMV, ProB, Spin) for the validation of information system specifications. The same case study (a library system) is specified using each model checker. Fifteen properties of various types are checked using temporal logics (CTL and LTL), first-order logic and failure-divergence (fdr2). Three characteristics are evaluated: ease of specifying information system i) behavior, ii) properties, and iii) the number of IS entity instances that can be checked. The paper then identifies the most suitable features required to validate information systems using a model checker. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {This paper presents the formal verification of a primary-to-secondary leaking (abbreviated as PRISE) safety procedure in a nuclear power plant (NPP). The software for the PRISE is defined by the Function Block Diagram specification method. Our approach to the formal verification of the PRISE safety procedure is based on the coloured Petri net (CPN) representation. The CPN model of the checked software is derived by reinterpretation from the FBD diagram, using a pre-developed library of CPN subnets. This results in a high-level, hierarchical coloured Petri net, that has an almost identical structure to the FBD specification. The state space of the CPN model was drastically reduced by "folding" equivalent states and trajectories into equivalence classes. Some of the safety properties could be proven based on the SCC (strongly connected components) graph of the reduced state space. Other properties were proven by CTL temporal logic based model checking. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are embedded computers widely used in industrial control systems. Ensuring that a PLC software complies with its specification is a challenging task. Formal verification has become a recommended practice to ensure the correctness of safety-critical software, but is still underused in industry due to the complexity of building and managing formal models of real applications. In this paper, we propose a general methodology to perform automated model checking of complex properties expressed in temporal logics [e.g., computation tree logic (CTL) and linear temporal logic (LTL)] on PLC programs. This methodology is based on an intermediate model (IM) meant to transform PLC programs written in various standard languages [structured text (ST), sequential function chart (SFC), etc.] to different modeling languages of verification tools. We present the syntax and semantics of the IM, and the transformation rules of the ST and SFC languages to the nuXmv model checker passing through the IM. Finally, two real cases studies of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) PLC programs, written mainly in the ST language, are presented to illustrate and validate the proposed approach. 1551-3203},

@article{Biere2003,
abstract = {Symbolic model checking with Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) has been successfully used in the last decade for formally verifying finite state systems such as sequential circuits and protocols. Since its introduction in the beginning of the 90's, it has been integrated in the quality assurance process of several major hardware companies. The main bottleneck of this method is that BDDs may grow exponentially, and hence the amount of available memory restricts the size of circuits that can be verified efficiently. In this article we survey a technique called Bounded Model Checking (BMC), which uses a propositional SAT solver rather than BDD manipulation techniques. Since its introduction in 1999, BMC has been well received by the industry. It can find many logical errors in complex systems that can not be handled by competing techniques, and is therefore widely perceived as a complementary technique to BDD-based model checking. This observation is supported by several independent comparisons that have been published in the last few years.},

The IEC 61499 function block architecture is assumed to be the input language, and the Intelligent Mechatronic Components (IMC) architecture is assumed as an underlying design pattern for the applications, which implies autonomous control logic in each IMC and their compositions to systems in a plug-and-play way. Then the system is automatically verified using model checking and the counter examples for the failed model checking properties are played back step-by-step and state-by-state in the simulation model that most industrial automation control systems would have built as the basis for initial testing. Net Condition Event Systems formalism (a modular extension of Petri net) is used to model the decentralized control logic and discrete-state dynamics of the plant. The model is then subjected to model checking using the ViVe/SESA tool chain. The method's application is illustrated using a simple pick and place manipulator. A closed loop model of Plant and Controller is used. Controller is extensively verified for safety, liveliness and functional properties of the robot. We then show how a counter example for deadlock detected by the model checker is played back in the simulation model for visualizing how exactly the system deadlocked.},

The study provides useful information for the planning of inspections, maintenance operations and decommissioning of the facility as well as for the assessment of radiological conditions and safety requirements in the design and operation of any accelerator-driven radioactive ion beam facility. To better assess the obtained results, two Monte Carlo codes were independently used: MCNPX combined with CINDER'90 and FLUKA. The results of the two calculation procedures are compared at each step: fissions, fluxes, activation, dose rate. Since the energy range considered does not represent a typical application for any of the two codes, the comparison of the collected results can provide useful inputs for the developers. In particular, the agreement of the two codes on the global quantities is good, being of the order of 20–40{\%} on average, and never larger than a factor 2. Nevertheless, the comparative study shows that, in this energy range, FLUKA seems to underestimate the angular straggling of protons and to overestimate the proton interaction cross-sections, with respect to MCNPX.},

abstract = {IC3 is a recently proposed verification technique for the analysis of sequential circuits. IC3 incrementally overapproximates the state space, refuting potential violations to the property at hand by constructing relative inductive blocking clauses. The algorithm relies on aggressive use of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) techniques, and has demonstrated impressive effectiveness. In this paper, we present the first investigation of IC3 in the setting of software verification. We first generalize it from SAT to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), thus enabling the direct analysis of programs after an encoding in form of symbolic transition systems. Second, to leverage the Control-Flow Graph (CFG) of the program being analyzed, we adapt the "linear" search style of IC3 to a tree-like search. Third, we cast this approach in the framework of lazy abstraction with interpolants, and optimize it by using interpolants extracted from proofs, when useful. The experimental results demonstrate the great potential of IC3, and the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

IMA can effectively reduce research and development costs and improve efficiency by reducing weight and power consumption through comprehensive resource integration or high resource-sharing comparison. However, failures in IMA may have catastrophic consequences. Failure analysis and verification of this system have become increasingly challenging. Model checking is an efficient technique to verify whether all the state transition traces satisfy the safety requirements or safety properties; however, difficulties are associated with defining or analyzing appropriate safety requirements, including for potential hazards. Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis can be used to identify potential failure hazards in complex systems. In this paper, a technique integrating which Systems-theoretic Process Analysis and model checking is proposed to perform failure analysis and verification, which better identify potential failure, derive safety requirements, and find failure propagation paths. Finally, the validity of the method is verified in the case study. The results indicate the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique is today established as one of the primary methods to produce high-intensity and highquality radioactive beams. This technique produces, for a given amount of the desired isotope, many orders of magnitude of other radioactive species. Due to the activation generated by interactions of the primary beam, intense neutron fields, and deposition of the produced radioactive ions inside beam line elements, an ISOL facility in operation becomes an intense radioactive source. Therefore, the biological hazard imposes severe radiological safety challenges to the design, operation, maintenance, and final decommissioning of such facilities. A challenging component is the ion source complex, where the ion extraction electrode provides the extraction of radioactive ions from the ion source and the first acceleration to the extracted beam. The radioactive contamination of this sub-component is studied, by means of the FLUKA code, in the case of the Selective Production of Exotic Species facility, which is in the advanced construction phase at Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Padua, Italy. The developed model includes isotope production by the interactions of a 40MeV energy proton beam on a 238UCx target, selection of radioactive isotopes that are able to stick on the electrode tip, time evolution of the deposited isotopes during the operation and cooling periods before maintenance interventions, and evaluation of the ambient dose equivalent rate generated by the contamination of the electrode tip. Based on these results, the possibility of manual interventions for maintenance and emergency vs the use of remote handling systems is discussed.},

ABSTRACT The ever-increasing complexity of automotive embedded systems and the need for safe advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) represent a great challenge for car manufacturers. Furthermore, we expect that in the near future, authorities require a software certification in order to get convinced that ADAS are safe enough. Theoretical research and experience show that when using conventional design approaches it is impossible to guarantee high confidence to those systems. The way taken by some industries (e.g. aerospace, railway, nuclear) was by partially using formal verification techniques. In this paper, we first present a background of the formal verification techniques and how they can contribute to achieve the requirements of some safety standards. Next, we share our experience with the application of those techniques that seem to be mature enough to be used in an industrial context: Static analysis based on Abstract Interpretation, SMT-based software Model checking and Deductive proof. Finally, we make a detailed analysis about our experiments and propose an approach introducing formal methods into the development of automotive embedded software.

Having a formal design leaves open the possibility of introducing model checking techniques. But, from our analysis of cases extracted from real software, a key issue concerns the exploitation of counterexamples showing property violation. Understanding the causes of the violation is not trivial, and the (unique) counterexample returned by a model checker is not necessarily realistic from an operational viewpoint. To address this issue, we propose an automated structural analysis that identifies paths of the model that are activated by a counterexample over time. This analysis allows us to extract relevant information to explain the observed violation. It may also serve to guide the model checker toward the search for different counterexamples, exhibiting new path activation patterns. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Thorough verification is a part of the design process of instrumentation and control systems if they must comply with crucial safety requirements. Model checking can be applied to the formal model of such a system to reason about its correctness based on the specification provided. When a violation occurs, the model checking tool outputs the proof of the violation in the form of a failure trace, which represents a state sequence of system model transitions where the requirement does not hold. This sequence, however, even for modular systems, is a mere table of values. Due to the lack of any insights into the inner model processes and structures that caused a problem, the debugging process of the formal model becomes time and effort consuming. The tool presented in this paper, Oeritte, is aimed at assisting the analyst in this challenge. It implements a method for automatic visual counterexample explanation which includes reasoning both over the falsified LTL formula and over the NuSMV function block diagram of the formal model of the system.

To improve this situation, a new approach is proposed that is based on the symbolic model checking tool NuSMV. A dual PID system is used as an example system, for which the logical part and the computational part of the system are modeled in a unified manner. Constraints are constructed on the controlled object, and a counterexample path is ultimately generated, indicating that the hybrid system can be analyzed by the model checking tool.},

This paper reviews research results related to the design of distributed automation systems with IEC 61499, the supporting tools and the aspects related to the execution of IEC 61499 on embedded devices. The promising application areas of IEC 61499 include flexible material handling systems, in particular airport baggage handling, flexible reconfigurable manufacturing automation, intelligent power distribution networks and SmartGrid, as well as the wide range of embedded networked systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Principles of Model Checking Baier and Katoen computer science Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties. This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a mature and widely used approach with many applications. Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field. The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata-based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and theoretical nature. " This book offers one of the most comprehensive introductions to logic model checking techniques available today. The authors have found a way to explain both basic concepts and foundational theory thoroughly and in crystal-clear prose. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn about this important new field, or brush up on their knowledge of the current state of the art." Gerard J. Holzmann, NASA/JPL Laboratory for Reliable Software " Principles of Model Checking, by two principals of model-checking research, offers an extensive and thorough coverage of the state of art in computer-aided verification. With its coverage of timed and probabilistic systems, the reader gets a textbook exposition of some of the most advanced topics in model-checking research. Obviously, one cannot expect to cover this heavy volume in a regular graduate course; rather, one can base several graduate courses on this book, which belongs on the bookshelf of every model-checking researcher."},

Model checking is computationally demanding, but nuclear I{\&}C systems have certain properties that simplify the verification problem. The most notable of these properties are redundancy (duplication of certain system parts in several divisions) and symmetry, which are the means of ensuring failure tolerance. In this work, we extend our previous method of model checking failure tolerance of nuclear I{\&}C systems by proposing an automated symmetry breaking approach that utilizes these properties to simplify the verification problem. As a result, fewer failure combinations need to be checked.

abstract = {Many different methods have been devised for automatically verifying finite state systems by examining state-graph models of system behavior. These methods all depend on decision procedures that explicitly represent the state space using a list or a table that grows in proportion to the number of states. We describe a general method that represents the state space symbolically instead of explicitly. The generality of our method comes from using a dialect of the Mu-Calculus as the primary specification language. We describe a model checking algorithm for Mu-Calculus formulas that uses Bryant's Binary Decision Diagrans (Bryant, R. E., 1986, IEEE Trans. Comput.C-35) to represent relations and formulas. We then show how our new Mu-Calculus model checking algorithm can be used to derive efficient decision procedures for CTL model checking, satisfiability of linear-time temporal logic formulas, strong and weak observational equivalence of finite transition systems, and language containment for finite $\omega$-automata. The fixed point computations for each decision procedure are sometimes complex, but can be concisely expressed in the Mu-Calculus. We illustrate the practicality of our approach to symbolic model checking by discussing how it can be used to verify a simple synchronous pipeline circuit. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Significantly, this will also cause risks to workers and environment, which has led engineers to explore the use and implementation of mobile robots (MR), in order to reduce or eliminate such risks concerned with safety issues. Safe functioning of MR and the systems working at hazardous facilities is essential and therefore all the systems, structures and components (SSC) of a hazardous facility have to correspond to high reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (=RAMS) demands. RAMS characteristics have a causal relationship with the risks related to the facility systems availability, safety and life cycle costs. They also form the basis for the operating systems and MR performance, to carry out the desired functions. In this paper we have developed and presented a method for how to consider and model a SSC with respect to its desired functions and also the computer-supported modeling and analysis of functional failure modes cause-consequence logic of a complex system, to ensure its RAMS characteristics during design and development phase, with an application approach to MR power outage. On the basis of experience and assisted by the modeled cause consequence logic it becomes possible to identify the problem areas, which during the design and development phase may reduce the RAMS performance and delay its design and development time. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

If a model of the system being verified does not satisfy a specification, the failure scenario is presented to the user as a counterexample trace. Analysis of the counterexample can be time-consuming if the trace is long, the model is large, or the specification is complex. Spurious counterexamples ("false negatives") often exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we present a method that assists in identifying the root of the failure in both the model and the specification, by animating the model of the function block diagram as well as the LTL property. We also introduce a practical tool for visualizing LTL properties by animation and highlighting of important values based on causality.

This allows to make correct implementation of time-aware systems and significantly simplify the construction of models for verification and simulation, as well as ensure fairness of the model and determinism of the function block system execution at a resource level. The model formalism is based on a well-known abstract state machines (ASM) notion, which can be used as an intermediate formal representation to generate a variety of models for different purposes, e.g. formal verification, and executable code. This paper exemplifies this approach by the generation of models in the SMV language. The paper discusses the time-aware computation concept and its application in a few related case studies.

abstract = {IEC 61499 emerged as a language for modeling distributed control systems. An Application is a platform-independent model that is comprised of modular components. High reusability of these components and high reconfigurability of the underlying system configuration can only be achieved with advanced design patterns. We show two example implementations of such designs and extended a pattern to foster reuse. All designs are compared based on a set of evaluation criteria. We show that our proposed design provides improved understandability and adaptability, while maintaining a slim library with highly reusable Function Block types.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an idea of a validatable architecture for software intensive industrial automation systems. The validation means will be provided through the formal modeling of automation systems, including both modeling of uncontrolled behavior of the equipment and modeling of the control system. This will be achieved through the facilitated reuse and integration of basic models to the models of complex systems. The validation will be empowered by advanced formal verification techniques combined with more usual testing by simulation. The discussed architecture bases on the latest developments in automation such as IEC61499 standard, on the latest trends in model-based software engineering, e.g. UML, and on modular modeling concepts of Condition/Event Systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

@book{schneider2004,
abstract = {Reactive systems are becoming more and more important for essentially all areas of technical and professional activities as well as for many areas of everyday life. The design of these systems is a great challenge and requires sound compromises between safety and time-to-market. To meet these needs, early design phases nowadays include verification of given specifications against system descriptions to find potential design errors as early as possible. This book is devoted to the foundation of the most popular formal methods for the specification and verification of reactive systems. In particular, the $\mu$-calculus, omega-automata, and temporal logics are covered in full detail; their relationship and state-of-the-art verification procedures based on these formal approaches are presented. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the formalisms from particular points of view are analyzed. Most results are given with detailed proofs, so that the presentation is almost self-contained. This book is targeted to advanced students, lecturers and researchers in the area of formal methods.},

abstract = {Distributed automation systems design is getting increasingly popular as the systems become more complex and modular. The IEC 61499 automation architecture is seen as the main enabler of component software design for distributed automation systems. It requires novel approaches to integrated development environments (IDE) supporting the engineering of such component software systems. One important part of automation systems engineering is their verification and validation. The efficacy of verification is largely dependent on how seamlessly this process is integrated with the traditional development tools, such as editors, compilers and debuggers. This work presents a start of such a development, that automatizes the model checking process for IEC 61499 systems and provides a visual explanation of its results in the graphical development environment FBME.},

They are used a lot in the field of software engineering, especially for object-oriented software development. Different standards exist for design and development of industrial cyber-physical systems and the IEC 61499 standard is one of them. The standard presents a reference component architecture for design and development of distributed industrial cyberphysical systems. There is a lack of design patterns for application development with IEC 61499 standard and this paper address this by proposing some patterns. The design patterns presented are inspired by popular design patterns used in software engineering.},

abstract = {The SPES (Selective Production of Exotic Species) facility, currently under development at Legnaro National Laboratories of INFN, aims at the production of intense RIB (Radioactive Ion Beams) employing the Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique for interdisciplinary research. The radioactive isotopes of interest are produced by the interaction of a multi-foil uranium carbide target with a 40 MeV 200 $\mu$A proton beam generated by a cyclotron proton driver. The Target Ion Source (TIS) is the core of the SPES project, here the radioactive nuclei, mainly neutron-rich isotopes, are stopped, extracted, ionized, separated, accelerated and delivered to specific experimental areas. Due to efficiency reasons, the TIS unit needs to be replaced periodically during operation. In this highly radioactive environment, the employment of autonomous systems allows the manipulation, transport, and storage of the TIS unit without the need for human intervention. A dedicated remote handling infrastructure is therefore under development to fulfill the functional and safety requirement of the project. This contribution describes the layout of the SPES target area, where all the remote handling systems operate to grant the smooth operation of the facility avoiding personnel exposure to a high dose rate or contamination issues.},
