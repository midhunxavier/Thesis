abstract = {Software engineering in the industrial automation domain requires generic methods to keep the development complexity at an acceptable level. However, nowadays various PLC vendors use different dialects of the standardized programming languages in their tools, which hinders the re-usability and interoperability across the platforms. The service-oriented approaches can serve to overcome interoperability issues. In distributed control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface that hides away the low-level implementation details of a particular functionality and provides a common semantic model for the execution. Further, we show how using such an interface can help to support and automate the overall engineering process, combining the functionality of different components to fulfill a production task. The reference implementation of the proposed concept was used in an industrial demonstrator, which shows the benefits in the system flexibility due to components interoperability and re-usability compared to the traditional control approaches.},

abstract = {It has become more crucial to apply energy-efficient optimization not only to individual manufacturing factors but the whole manufacturing systems with the aim of greening of manufacturing. This study proposes an energy-efficient optimization technique for operations in a flexible manufacturing system with several machine tools by introducing a concept of a processing mode and energy-load profile. This study focuses on how a processing mode, describing machining conditions involving energy-aware operations, is derived and conducts some cutting experiments. An optimization model to generate the energy load profile is also formulated and it is demonstrated that the energy load profile has a role of the basis for energy-efficient machining operations as well as the manufacturing system through some computational simulations.}

abstract = {The increasing expansion of renewable energies and the shortage of fossil fuels lead to rising and increasingly fluctuating energy prices. To benefit from these significant fluctuations and to become less dependent on fossil energy sources, this paper shows how the electricity demand of cooling supply systems for industrial room air conditioning can be flexibly adapted to the volatile energy supply. For this purpose, an energy-flexible air-conditioned climate room with a smart chiller and thermal storage units was built as a demonstrator at the ETA research factory at the Technical University of Darmstadt. To determine the energy flexibilization potential and to develop flexible operating strategies, a thermal simulation model of the climate room was also created in the simulation environment Dymola and experimentally validated. In addition, an energy-flexible operation of the climate room was validated on the real system and the economic potential was determined as well as the impact on sustainability was derived. The demonstrator shows that in the application scenario of air conditioning of cold storage facilities 26.3 % of electricity costs and 20.6 % of CO2 emissions can be saved by the developed energy-flexible operating strategies. The findings can be transferred and scaled to different cooling supply systems for industrial air conditioning.}
