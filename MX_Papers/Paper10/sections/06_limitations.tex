\section{Limitations}
\label{sec::limitations}
We have proposed and implemented a framework for generating cross-platform tests for IEC~61499-based software. We used two tool environments to evaluate the portability and built on previous results of known execution issues. Currently, no industrial-scale FB libraries are publicly available for testing our approach in practice. As described in the paper, service sequences can serve as test cases for IEC~61499 FBs. However, there is no possibility to specify timing information \cite{Wiesmayr_ifac}. Our approach mainly targets the event-based behaviour of IEC~61499 FBs, while other approaches can cover timing verification (c.f. \cite{Bruns.2023}). 


\begin{comment}
    \item further research on test case generation would be useful
    \item no timing in the 1499 service sequences (e.g., send REQ every 15 ms), hence, also not part of the test generation approach
    \item timing also difficult to test with a test application, but well suitable for the typical problems of 1499 event-based systems
